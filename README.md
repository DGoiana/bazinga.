# pagepal

Find your perfect reading match!

With **pagepal**, we aim at reducing book waste. Like us, you probably have a ton of books, sitting on your shelves, which are probably never going to be read again. Wouldn't it be great if you could put those books to good use, and in turn, get new books to read at no cost? With **pagepal**, you can! With our taste-mathcing system, you can find someone with a book that you will love, and you can ask that person for books. If you give a book, you can get a book, while using our *Book Credits* system.

## Book Credits

This is a system where one can earn book credits when giving a book to someone, and can spend them by lending books from others.
